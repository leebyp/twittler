This was a project to get some hands on experience working with HTML, CSS and
jQuery to re-create a webpage to follow and respond to constantly updating tweets
from a pre-made data generator.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, as part of the precourse
work from [Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum.
